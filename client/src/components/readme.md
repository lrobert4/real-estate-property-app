# components

This directory is for react components. Every reusable react component should be separated and placed here.
 For example a styled button to navigate could be used to create a component that can be reused throughout your app

# Template Component File

See the `./HelloWorld.js` file for a template component file. Feel free to copy `HelloWorld.js`
when creating new react components and complete all steps labeled `TODO`
